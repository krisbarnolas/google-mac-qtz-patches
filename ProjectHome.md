A collection of Quartz Composer Patches. These patches require Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) or better.

- Ambient Light Sensor: use the ambient light in the room as inputs. Only works with machines with ambient light sensors (e.g. MacBook Pro)

- Motion Sensor: use the motion sensors as inputs. Only works with machines with motion sensors (e.g. MacBook Pro). Uses the [Unimotion](http://unimotion.sourceforge.net/) library.

Install these patches into "/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins" and then launch up Quartz Composer and play.
